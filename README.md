# Dropdown Character Maker

## Learning Objectives

- Use a for/of loop to run a function against every item in an array (i.e., console.log , alert ).
- In response to a user event, add a new item to a state array and display the new state to the user (i.e., add a new todo).
- Use the .value property to get the value of a 'grabbed' HTML form input tag
- Use .createElement() and .append() to display a new HTML tag (with .textContent ) to a grabbed DOM element on click.
- Use .createElement() and .append() to add a list of new DOMÂ  elements to a grabbed DOM element on click
- Create a select element to create a dropdown.
- Use `+` and `${}` to concatenate strings.
- Identify what variables are in a given scope/closure

| Select from at least three dropdowns with at least three options each                                                                                 |   2 |
| On choosing an option from the dropdown and see the change reflected in the UI with a new image                                                       |   1 |
| On change, See all catchphrases rendered to the DOM                                                                                                   |   2 |
| When submitting a catchphrase, add it to an array of catchphrases, clear the current DOM's list of catchphrases, and list all catchphrases in the DOM |   1 |
| See displayed how many times each dropdown has been changed in the current session                                                                    |   1 |

| IMPURE: `displayStats() : mutates the DOM to display a string describing the counts.`                                                       |   1 |
| IMPURE: `displayCatchphrases() : clears out the old list from the DOM, loops through catchphrases, renders and appends to the list element` |   2 |

Stretch Ideas for fun:

- Add some conditional logic that prevents a catch phrase from being added if value is empty
- Add the option for the user to name the character and store the name in state. Display that name in big letters at the top.
- Make three arrays of objects of this kind of shape: [ { display: "Duck head", value: "1" }, { display: "Blue Bird Head", value: "2" }, { display: "Horse Head", value: "3" ]. Now, instead of hard coding your dropdown options, generate them dynamically by looping over these arrays.
- Wrap the catchphrase input and button in a form tag and use a 'submit' handler with the new FormData() constructor to get data from the input. (Hint: Look up e.preventDefault() and why it's useful in this case)
- Use a radio button (probably the most challenging form input) to change between 'cartoon mode' and 'photo mode'. Load a different set of images (photo of duck vs cartoon duck, etc) depending on the mode.
- In addition to keeping track of the number of times each dropdown was changed, keep track of (and display to the user) a "history" of those changes.
